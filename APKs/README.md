## APK Directory

This directory contains the APKs employed for the tests. In particular:

- **Vanilla** contains the APKs with the steganography resource, and loader code without obfuscation mechanisms;
- **Obfuscated** contains the obfuscated version of the APKs aformentioned:
    1. **Custom** is the direcory with the custom built application with both *Obfuscapk* and *R8* Obfuscation
    2. **Telegram** is the directory with the repacked Telegram application with both *Obfuscapk* and *R8* Obfuscation

Instead, the file *data.md* shows the mapping between sha256 and application found in the paper.
